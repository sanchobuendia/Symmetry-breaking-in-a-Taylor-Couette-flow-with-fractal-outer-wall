# Symmetry breaking in a Taylor-Couette flow with fractal outer wall

This repository contains the files used to create the 2D base designs of 3D structures utilized in simulations for the research paper. The provided designs serve as foundational elements for reproducing and understanding the simulated models described in the study.

We used three generations of the square Koch fractal. For each generation, the process was divided into two scripts. Initially, we generated the points and exported a .txt file using a script written in MATLAB, files with the .m extension. Then, we copied the content of the .txt file and pasted it into the .js file used in Fluent to create the structure.

We also have the Fluent files used in the simulations. There are three configurations, and during the process, we only changed the angular velocity. These files can be downloaded from this folder on Google Drive [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aUzMcDfr_zfxkvUV3IG6FUihef8Dl8F4?usp=share_link).
